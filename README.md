# Multi-Lane Road Traffic Simulation (MuLtiRoTS)

## Introduction
MuLtiRoTS is a cellular automaton model of traffic on an n-lane highway. Based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, MuLtiRoTS was created for a 2nd-year university course with the purpose of understanding real life phenomena such as traffic jams and bus clumping. An attempt was also made at simulating crossroads and from there finding optimal traffic light timings. This was, however, unsuccessful. MuLtiRoTS is useful for gathering data on traffic flow given a set of constraints, and also producing visually pleasing animations of the simulation to better understand what is happening.
